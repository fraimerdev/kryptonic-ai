* üíæ **Data Persistence:** Connects to a MongoDB database to store, retrieve, and manage application data.  
* üåê **Web Interface:** A simple, server-rendered frontend built with Flask and Jinja2 to interact with the backend.  
* üîê **Secure Configuration:** Manages API keys and secrets cleanly using environment variables.  
* üöÄ **Deployment-Ready:** Includes instructions for production deployment using Gunicorn.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

#### 1. Install Dependencies:

First, clone the repository and install the required Python packages. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/fraimerdev/kryptonic-ai.git  
cd kryptonic-ai

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv  

# Activate virtual environment on MacOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

#Activate virtual environment on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your API keys and configuration.

```
# .env file

# OpenAI API Key  
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"

# MongoDB Connection String  
MONGO_URI="YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE"

# ScrapingAnt API Key  
SCRAPINGANT_API_KEY="YOUR_SCRAPINGANT_API_KEY_HERE"

# Flask Secret Key  
SECRET_KEY="a_strong_random_secret_key"
```

#### 3. **Run the Development Server:**

Start the local Flask server.

```bash
python app.py
```

#### 4. **Open the Application:**

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

## Project Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db.py               # MongoDB connection and helper functions  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # Project dependencies for pip  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/             # Static assets (CSS, JS, images)  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/          # Jinja2 HTML templates for the frontend  
```

## Deployment

To deploy this application to a production service like **Render**, **Heroku**, [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), or [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform), you will need to add the following files.

#### 1. **Add Gunicorn to requirements.txt:**

Ensure gunicorn is listed as a dependency for your production server.

```
# requirements.txt  
flask  
gunicorn  
python-dotenv  
langchain  
# ... all other dependencies
```

#### 2. **Create a `Procfile`:**

This file tells the hosting service how to start the application. Create a file named `Procfile` in the root directory.

```
web: gunicorn app:app
```

After adding these files, commit them and connect your repository to your hosting provider. Remember to set the environment variables in your provider's dashboard, not in the `.env` file.

## Available Scripts

* `python app.py` - Starts the local development server.  
* `gunicorn app:app` - Runs the app using the Gunicorn production server.
